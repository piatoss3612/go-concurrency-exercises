# Producer-Consumer Scenario

The producer reads in tweets from a mockstream and a consumer is processing the data to find out whether someone has tweeted about golang or not. The task is to modify the code inside `main.go` so that producer and consumer can run concurrently to increase the throughput of this program.

## Expected results:
Before: 
```
davecheney      tweets about golang
beertocode      does not tweet about golang
ironzeb         tweets about golang
beertocode      tweets about golang
vampirewalk666  tweets about golang
Process took 3.580866005s
```

After:
```
davecheney      tweets about golang
beertocode      does not tweet about golang
ironzeb         tweets about golang
beertocode      tweets about golang
vampirewalk666  tweets about golang
Process took 1.977756255s
```

## Solution

- Use channel to communicate between producer and consumer

```bash
$ go run .
davecheney      tweets about golang
beertocode      does not tweet about golang
ironzeb         tweets about golang
beertocode      tweets about golang
vampirewalk666  tweets about golang
Process took 1.973530152s
```
